                    “The Governor made this condemnation during a peace  meeting, at Jato-Aka Council Hall, where a delegation of the State government, stakeholders of the local government, and the representative of the Association, met to also brainstorm on investigation into the matter.
                    
                    “The cattle traders were conveying cows, bags of Rice, and live goats, to the Eastern part of the country, through Nyihemba community on a  thoroughfare, where their truck fell accidentally, leading to the ugly incident.
                    
                    “The Governor who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Joseph Alkali, expressed sadness over the attack, and directed that the Chiefs who are custodians of the communities, must produce the criminals believe to be youths within the communities.
